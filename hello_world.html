		From the moment my head began to crown into the world I knew that I was meant for <strong>greatness</strong>. You could have caught me preparing for the war with life by fighting my sister with my trusty sword (broom stick). <em>Unfortunately</em>, all my efforts to become the world's best fighter were rendered useless once high school came around. 
		<br>Mr. Cottrel saught to it that my four years of school were dedicated to <em>the most important aspect of life</em> which he believed was my eduation... And what a waste that was!
